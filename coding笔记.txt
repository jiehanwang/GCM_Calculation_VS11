To avoid wrong parameters, svm_check_parameter() should be
    called before svm_train().

- Function: double svm_predict_probability(const struct svm_model *model, 
	    const struct svm_node *x, double* prob_estimates);
    
    This function does classification or regression on a test vector x
    given a model with probability information.

    For a classification model with probability information, this
    function gives nr_class probability estimates in the array
    prob_estimates. nr_class can be obtained from the function
    svm_get_nr_class. The class with the highest probability is
    returned. For regression/one-class SVM, the array prob_estimates
    is unchanged and the returned value is the same as that of
    svm_predict.


HandSegment.cpp 中 getHogFeature函数中 hog->compute(handMat, descriptors,Size(0,0), Size(0,0)); 在debug下错误，但是在release下可以运行。
